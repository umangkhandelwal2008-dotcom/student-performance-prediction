"Student Performance Prediction (Machine Learning Project)
This project predicts a student’s final exam marks based on important academic and lifestyle factors such as:

Study hours

Attendance

Assignments completed

Sleep hours

Previous exam performance

It uses Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Linear Regression to train a machine-learning model and evaluate its performance.

🚀 Features
Clean and simple dataset (can be replaced with a real dataset)

Machine Learning model using Linear Regression

Evaluation metrics:

MAE – Mean Absolute Error

MSE – Mean Squared Error

RMSE – Root Mean Squared Error

Visualization of Actual vs Predicted Marks

Option to predict marks for new students

📁 Project Structure
📂 Student-Performance-Prediction
│── README.md
│── student_performance.py
│── requirements.txt (optional)
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

🔧 Installation
Install all required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
📌 Usage
Run the Python script:

python student_performance.py
The script will:

Load or create the dataset

Train-test split

Train the ML model

Predict on test data

Print evaluation scores

Plot a graph

Predict marks for a new student

📊 Sample Prediction (Example)
new_student = [[5, 90, 8, 7, 72]]
predicted_score = model.predict(new_student)
Output:

Predicted marks for new student: 79.52
📈 Visualization
The script generates a graph comparing:

Actual Scores

Predicted Scores

This helps visualize model performance.

📚 Future Improvements
You can enhance this project by:

Adding a larger real-life dataset

Using Random Forest or Neural Networks

Deploying the model on a Flask / Django web app

Adding a Tkinter GUI

Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy

🎯 Goal of the Project
To understand how multiple academic and behavioral factors impact a student’s performance, and how machine learning can be used to make reliable predictions."
